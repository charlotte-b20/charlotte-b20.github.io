<h4>
	Synopsis
</h4>

<p>
	Fifteen-year-old Lina is a Lithuanian girl living an ordinary life — until Soviet officers invade her home and tear her family apart. Separated from her father and forced onto a crowded train, Lina, her mother, and her young brother make their way to a Siberian work camp, where they are forced to fight for their lives. Lina finds solace in her art, documenting these events by drawing. Risking everything, she imbeds clues in her drawings of their location and secretly passes them along, hoping her drawings will make their way to her father’s prison camp. But will strength, love, and hope be enough for Lina and her family to survive?

	This book in incredible. The writing is beautiful, and I was hooked as soon as I started reading it. The way that Sepetys was able to convey the immense love that was obviously present is astonishing. Every time I opened the book, I was consumed by the beauty of the writing and the tragedy of the story itself. It's an important book to read, so please do.

	It was an okay read. While it does tell an important story, Sepetys could have told it so much better. The ending was... well, there wasn't really an ending.
