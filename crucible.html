	The Crucible

<h4>
	Synopsis
</h4>

<p>
	In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the townâ€™s most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.

	Ugh, if I could travel back in time and stop myself from reading this, I 100% would. It was so increedibly boring and hard to read. Don't even try on this one.

	I really enjoyed reading this. I could tell that I was pulled into the play when I got so angry at the book that I threw it across the room! I may have overreacted a little bit, but this is a great play!
