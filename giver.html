<h4>
	Synopsis
</h4>

<p>
	December is the time of the annual Ceremony at which each twelve-year-old receives a life assignment determined by the Elders. Jonas watches his friend Fiona named Caretaker of the Old and his cheerful pal Asher labeled the Assistant Director of Recreation. But Jonas has been chosen for something special. When his selection leads him to an unnamed man-the man called only the Giver-he begins to sense the dark secrets that underlie the fragile perfection of his world.

	This book disgusted me. It's marketed towards children when in reality, it's brutal and terrible. It's just about killing babies and suppressing your identity, which is an awful thing to teach children. Honestly, this book is NOT for kids, don't waste your money on it.
