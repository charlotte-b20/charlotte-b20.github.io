<h2>HOW WE STARTED</h2>

<p>Our founder, who shall remain anonymous, always loved reading as a kid. She liked to escape the real world through stories about faraway lands and the past. She dreamed of living with Laura Ingalls Wilder in her Little House on the Prairie and writing books with Jo March. Though she was not blessed with the ability to create amazing and all-consuming tales of adventure and strife, she hopes to be able to help others experience it by providing them with as many books as they could ever want. It is her hope that through each new book, or poem, or even biography, you gain a new perspective and appreciation for literature. Books were her escape, but they can be a new beginning for you. Have fun reading! (For a look at some of the founder's favorite books, scroll down a little bit!)</p>
