<h4>
	Synopsis
</h4>

<p>
	When Frankie’s mother died and her father left her and her siblings at an orphanage in Chicago, it was supposed to be only temporary—just long enough for him to get back on his feet and be able to provide for them once again. That’s why Frankie's not prepared for the day that he arrives for his weekend visit with a new woman on his arm and out-of-state train tickets in his pocket.

	Now Frankie and her sister, Toni, are abandoned alongside so many other orphans—two young, unwanted women doing everything they can to survive.

	And as the embers of the Great Depression are kindled into the fires of World War II, and the shadows of injustice, poverty, and death walk the streets in broad daylight, it will be up to Frankie to find something worth holding on to in the ruins of this shattered America—every minute of every day spent wondering if the life she's able to carve out will be enough.

	This has to be my all time favorite book. Ruby does a fantastic job bringing the readers along on both Pearl and Frankie's journeys. Frankie, Pearl, and Marguerite have become my new role models, and they are so strong in the face of every struggle they have to face. Please, please, PLEASE read this!! I guarantee it will change your life!

	I thouroughly enjoyed this book. The way that Ruby weaves Frankie and Pearl's stories together is slightly difficult to understand at first, but you just need to. stick with it. Overall, it's a great book!
