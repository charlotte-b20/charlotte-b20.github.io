<h4>
	Synopsis
</h4>

<p>
	Grown-up Meg, tomboyish Jo, timid Beth, and precocious Amy. The four March sisters couldn’t be more different. But with their father away at war, and their mother working to support the family, they have to rely on one another. Whether they’re putting on a play, forming a secret society, or celebrating Christmas, there’s one thing they can’t help wondering: Will Father return home safely?

	Honestly, this is the best book I have ever read. Jo, Beth, Meg, and Amy are all amazing people. I want sisters like them, a mother like Marmee, a best friend like Laurie. I'm still a little bit confused about the ending (I mean, who even was the professor guy??), but all's well that ends well. Basically, you should read it, it'll make your day.

	I just didn't vibe with it. I know that a lot of people like the story, especially because of the new movie, but I don't.
